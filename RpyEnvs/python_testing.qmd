This is very sketchy as I figure out some python testing and debug. Mostly notes for myself. In theory, I should be able to test the package by just calling `pytest` at a terminal, but it frequently fails. I get an error

```         
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_trying_to_test'
```

The project I'm working in already has pytest set up, but when i call `pytest test_script.py`, it can't find the module I'm developing). The solution seems to be to use

```         
python -m pytest tests/test_script.py
```

From the project root directory.

It also seems to often work to just run

```         
python -m pytest
```

*Note* if you have a file with 'test' in the name, `pytest` will try to run it. So don't have e.g. `figuring_stuff_out_test.py` in there.
