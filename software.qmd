## [eFlowEval](https://github.com/galenholt/eFlowEval)

A workflow and R package for modelling ecological response in flexible but standardised ways in wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin, with capacity for spatial scaling and synthesis. See @holt2024.

## [peeler](https://github.com/galenholt/peeler)

An R package implementing the bvstep algorithm from @clarke1998 and provides the ability to 'peel' those outcomes (not recommended).

## Other

I have a number of [other repositories](https://github.com/galenholt) consisting of data analyses for published papers and demonstration/testing/template repositories (often discussed in more detail in [code demos](code_demos.qmd).)

## Private packages

I develop a number of other packages and data analysis repositories, but most are private due to data embargoes.
