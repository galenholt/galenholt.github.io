# The issue

I really don't like how faint the selection colours are for all of the dark themes. When I do a 'find', I don't want to hunt around for dark grey on black. So to fix that, I need to edit the theme.

## Creating a new theme

I went to [this massive list of themes](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Tomorrow-Night), clicked 'gallery', chose the one I wanted (just a simple edit of Tomorrow Night, will save a more complex hunt for another day). Then the pane in the middle lets us change all the colours. I clicked the 'General' tab, and changed the `lineHighlight` and `selection` to a nice blue. I also changed the comment colour to green, not sure if I like that or not.

Then, go to the 'Info' tab and change the name before downloading. Otherwise Rstudio won't find it under a new name.

Download. This saves as a `.tmTheme` file, which I think might just be able to be used directly (see new [Posit documentation](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-ide-custom-theme-support/), but I was looking at something old and so used `rstudioapi::convertTheme('setup/Tomorrow Night HL.tmTheme', outputLocation = 'setup')` to create a `.rstheme` file.

Then global options, add, and select the theme. I had to restart Rstudio a couple times for it to take. The edited theme is available in the git for this website.
