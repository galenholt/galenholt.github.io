I've been dealing with debugging a package with a dplyr warning that only appears every 8 hours with the message

``` R
This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.
```

It causes warnings every time I test the *whole* package with `devtools::test()`, but only every 8 hours otherwise, which makes tracing and debugging impossible.

{rlang} provides a way to set {lifecycle} warning frequencies ([docs](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/verbosity.html)) so I set in my test script

```{r}
#| eval: false
rlang::local_options(lifecycle_verbosity = "warning")

```

I think this should do it too

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(lifecycle_verbosity = "warning")
```
