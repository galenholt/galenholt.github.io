title: "Snapshot failures on check"
format: html
---

Sometimes I have all tests pass with `devtools::test()`, but then encounter failures with `devtools::check()`. When these are for golden tests (snapshots, whether from `testthat` itself or `vdiffr`, the output says

```         
* Run `testthat::snapshot_review('name_of_file')` to interactively review the change.
```

But nothing happens, because the `filename.new.md` or `filename.new.svg` aren't available in the main package directory.

To get it to work, go find the `packagename.Rcheck` directory, then go to `/tests/testthat/snaps` and copy the offending `.new` files into the main working project `tests/testthat/snaps` . Then you can run `testthat::snapshot_review('name_of_file')` .

I tend to find the `packagename.Rcheck` directory one level up from the package project directory, though I'm not sure if that's consistent.
