title: "Package DLL not found"

Since upgrading Rstudio, I keep getting this error:

```         
Error in library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib) :    DLL ‘testthat’ not found: maybe not installed for this architecture?
```

It's intermittent- I could use `testthat` the day before. And it seems to hit packages randomly. Very frustrating. The only solution seems to be to use

```{r}
renv::paths$cache()
```

to find the cache, delete that package, and reinstall it.
