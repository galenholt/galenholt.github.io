title: "Dplyr filter matrices"

As of dplyr 1.1.0, we get warnings about using 1-d matrices instead of logical vectors.

```         
Warning: Using one column matrices in `filter()` was deprecated in dplyr 1.1.0.
â„¹ Please use one dimensional logical vectors instead.
```

This is hard to find and debug, because the warning is lifecycle-limited, but [setting the lifecycle warning options](lifecycle_warnings.qmd) makes it possible.

```{r}
rlang::local_options(lifecycle_verbosity = "warning")
```

In most cases, it seems to happen with the column name to filter on as a character. It *is* a strange pattern, but comes up a fair amount programming.

```{r}

filtercol <- 'Species'

iris |> 
  dplyr::filter(dplyr::across(tidyselect::any_of(filtercol)) == 'virginica')
```

The solution is to use `.data`

```{r}
iris |> 
  dplyr::filter(.data[[filtercol]] == 'virginica')
```
