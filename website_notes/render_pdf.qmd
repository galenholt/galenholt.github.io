Just like the [word version](render_word.qmd), sometimes we want to render something other than just html. This is working through specific issues with pdf.

``` yaml
format:
  pdf: default
```

It was just working for me to use `elsevier-pdf: default` in my header, but now it's not working to just use simple `pdf`. I get the error

```         
compilation failed- no matching packages
LaTeX Error: File `scrartcl.cls' not found.
```

Consensus seems to be to reinstall tinytex. `quarto install tinytex` says it's installed but will update.

That did get it to work. I think somehow I had tinytex, but not the KOMA Script documentclasses [Quarto uses by default](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#overview).
