## Links from images

To include an image with a link, use the usual image insertion code, e.g. this is not clickable

``` markdown
![Surus](../_images/surus.png)
```

![Surus](../_images/surus.png)

but modified with square brackets and parentheses similarly to text links makes it clickable.

``` markdown
[![Surus](../_images/surus.png)](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/authoring/_figure-examples)
```

[![Surus](../_images/surus.png)](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/authoring/_figure-examples)

If we want to adjust the size, it needs to go in the square brackets, and *not have spaces*.

``` markdown
[![Surus](../_images/surus.png){width=200}](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/authoring/_figure-examples)
```

[![Surus](../_images/surus.png){width="200"}](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/authoring/_figure-examples)

We can also use a figure div to make it cross-referenceable.

``` markdown
::: {#fig-elephant}

[![Surus](../_images/surus.png)](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/tree/main/docs/authoring/_figure-examples)

## Icons

We can include `icon` items in the yaml to include icons from [bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), but what if we want to include others? The impetus for this is google scholar, but I could also foresee using something like [phylopic](https://www.phylopic.org/).

The trick it looks like is to install (or write, but let's leave that for later) a Quarto extension. Academicons comes up early in google, but [Iconify](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify) seems to contain that set and a bunch more.

To install, use `quarto add mcanouil/quarto-iconify` at the terminal.

To use, include `"{{< iconify setname iconname>}}"`. Note that when you find the icon, Iconify gives the name as `setname:iconname`, and we need to quote it in the yaml.

This seems to work here, e.g. the google scholar icon is

```markdown

{{< iconify academicons google-scholar-square >}}

```

{{< iconify academicons google-scholar-square >}}

but I can't get it to work in the yaml, even with quotes.

Simply downloading the image and giving a path in the yaml doesn't work either.
