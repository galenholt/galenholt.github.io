This is a placeholder. I am a community ecologist with a focus on aquatic ecology. My background is in theoretical community ecology, though I also do fieldwork in aquatic systems and develop management-focused models. I have a particular interest in scaling, probabalistic modeling, and climate impacts.

Postdoctoral researcher in the [QAEL Lab](https://www.qael.org/) at Deakin University.
